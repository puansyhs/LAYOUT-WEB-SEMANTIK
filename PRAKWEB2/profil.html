      <p>Click Insert and then choose the elements you want 
					from the different galleries. Themes and styles 
					also help keep your document coordinated. When you 
					click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, 
					charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your 
					new theme. When you apply styles, your headings 
					change to match the new theme. Save time in Word 
					with new buttons that show up where you need them.	
			        To change the way a picture fits in your document,
					click it and a button for layout options appears 
					next to it. When you work on a table, click where 
					you want to add a row or a column, and then click 
					the plus sign. Reading is easier, too, in the new 
					Reading view. You can collapse parts of the 
					document and focus on the text you want. If you 
					need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word 
					remembers where you left off even on another 
					device</p>
